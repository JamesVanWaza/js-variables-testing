# js-variables-testing
Testing of addition and subtraction of variables

# Created on Jun 07, 2025 13:06

This project is dedicated to testing, displaying, and experimenting with large sets of variables in JavaScript.  
It includes a comprehensive `variables.json` file containing a sequence of variable names (a, b, ..., z, aa, ..., zzz..., etc.) mapped to integer values, currently ranging from 1 to 1000.  
A Bootstrap-based HTML interface is provided to visually display the variables and their values.

## Files

- `variables.json` — Contains variable name/integer mappings from 1 to 1000 (e.g., `"a": 1, "b": 2, ..., "zzzz...": 1000`).
- `variables-bootstrap-536.html` — Loads and displays the variables in a responsive Bootstrap 5.3.6 grid.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `variables-bootstrap-536.html` in your browser (requires local access to `variables.json`).
3. Explore or modify the code for your JavaScript variable testing purposes.
